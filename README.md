<h1>mm-pge - the repo for my website</h1>
<p>mm-pge or "<a href="mailmanmicky.github.io" target="_blank"; text-decoration:none;">mailmanmicky.github.io</a>" is my personal website in which I intend to document the changelogs of my projects, make blogposts and generally just do other wacky html nonsense. <strong>It's still considered a work in progress, as the major components have yet to be added.</strong></p>
