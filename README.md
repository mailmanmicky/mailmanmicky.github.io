<h1><img src="images/iconwh64.svg"> mm-pge - the repo for my website</h1>
<p>mm-pge is the repository for https://mailmanmicky.github.io. My personal     website where I intend to: 
                                    <ol type="a">
    <li> Document the changelogs of my projects </li>
    <li> Make blogposts </li>
    <li> Do other wacky html nonsense! </li>
</ol>
<br>
<strong>The site is still considered a work in progress since the major components have yet to be added.</strong></p>
