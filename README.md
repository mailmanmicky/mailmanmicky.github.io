<h1>mm-pge - the repo for my website</h1>
<p>mm-pge or "<a href="mailmanmicky.github.io" target="_blank"; text-decoration:none;">mailmanmicky.github.io</a>" is my personal website where I intend to: 
<li> Document the changelogs of my projects </li>
<li> Make blogposts </li>
<li> Do other wacky html nonsense! </li>
<br>
<strong>The site is still considered a work in progress since the major components have yet to be added.</strong></p>
